# JavaTale

A moddable Undertale engine in Java.

## Getting Started

### Eclipse
The repo is already configured as an Eclipse project. To set it up, right click on
your package explorer and select `Import > Projects from Git > Clone URI`.

Paste the repo URL (or your fork's repo URL), click all of the
'Next' buttons and then click 'Finish'. This should add the project to your Eclipse workspace.

The LWJGL jars and other required libraries should be automatically resolved and downloaded by
Maven. If they are not, try clicking on the project and clicking 'F5' to refresh it. You should see 
a libary folder added to the project labelled 'Maven Dependencies'.
